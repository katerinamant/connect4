# Game of Connect Four built in Python

The players choose the columns of the board.

The player chooses where to place a piece.
The player gets 4 points for a win.
They get an extra point for every neighboring piece of theirs.
The winning pieces are removed and the board is moved accordingly.
Afterwards the board is checked again for more wins and, if there are any, the process is repeated.
The process stops when no wins are found and it's the next player's turn.

The players have the possibility to save their progress to a CSV file.
The game ends when the board is full.
